**Create Test Data for Process Activity indicative of ProxyShell exploitation**

**Information Gathering**:

The vulnerabilities lie in the Microsoft Client Access Service (CAS) that
typically runs on port 443 in IIS (Microsoftâ€™s web server). CAS is commonly
exposed to the public internet to enable users to access their email via mobile
devices and web browsers. Remote attackers can exploit 3 separate CAS
vulnerabilities within Microsoft Exchange to bypass authentication and obtain
privileged remote code execution capabilities.

Post-auth remote code execution via arbitrary file write

Based on our understanding of the available ProxyShell exploits such as
Metasploit ProxyShell RCE module, we know that the exploit will load a reverse
shell hosted in IIS therefore the attacker will be able to execute
post-exploitation commands as a child process to the IIS worker process.
