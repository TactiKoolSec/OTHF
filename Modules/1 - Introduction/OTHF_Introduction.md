1.  Introduction

Establishing or maturing an effective threat hunting program is a challenging
task compared to approaching threat hunting from an unofficial perspective where
existing security resources execute ad-hoc hunts in their spare time however, a
well-designed and dedicated threat hunting program can be a major driver in
changing the security culture of an entire organization.

The purpose of this document is to provide foundational understanding of Threat
Hunting and introduce the Open Threat Hunt Framework (OTHF) which are practical
guidelines to developing and maturing an effective threat hunting program.

The goal of the OTHF is to provide organizations with a framework which provides
guidance on implementing core organizational, operational, and technical
components to launch and mature threat hunting operation. The OTHF is completely
vendor and tool agnostic and not meant to be an exhaustive resource on threat
hunting techniques or analysis but instead designed to present organizations
with often overlooked pieces of threat hunting that have a massive impact on the
success of the program.

While the overall OTHF is designed for organizations attempting to launch and
mature a dedicated threat hunting program staffed with dedicated resources, the
OTHF is modular by design to accommodate organizations who are unable to staff a
dedicated team but can still leverage the operational components to begin or
improve threat hunting within their organization.
