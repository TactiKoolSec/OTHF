### Communication Strategy

No one is going to care how good your team is if you can’t communicate how good
your team is.

One of the more underrated aspects of designing and operating a threat hunting
organization is developing a strategy to communicate with leadership how the
investment into threat hunting is generating a positive impact on the
organization. If the only message the threat hunt team delivers to key
stakeholders and leadership is whether threat hunting identified malicious
activity, it will be extremely difficult to realize the full value threat
hunting is bringing to the organization.

Detecting malicious activity is clearly part of threat hunting and when
malicious activity is discovered through threat hunting, it should immediately
be presented to leadership however, threat hunting can also improve the general
security posture of the organization by reducing attack surface, improving
detection capabilities, improve security data quality, and identify enablers of
an attack.

The first step is to identify and generate valuable metrics and KPIs (see the
Metrics section of the OTHF for more details on metric generation) which
underpin the communication strategy of the threat hunting program. Without good
data to back up your communications strategy there is very little chance for
success. At the same time, if all you have is good data the likelihood of that
data making an impact on the perception of the threat hunting program to
leadership will be reduced.

A communication strategy can help the threat hunt program by tying together the
relevant metrics into unified story which stakeholders can not only easily
understand the data but also understand why they should care.

A threat hunting communication strategy should include:

-   Goal

-   Key Messaging

-   Target stakeholders

-   Metric alignment

**Goal** – Desired results for the program delivering the communication. The
goal should align with short-, medium-, or long-term goals of the program.

**Key Messaging** – Whenever you communicate, you want each receiver to
understand the basic points and takeaways. The basic points and takeaways are
the key messages, and each receiver should be able to sum up the point of what
is being said within a sentence or two.

**Target Stakeholders** – A stakeholder is any individual or that has an
interest in an organization and the outcomes of its actions. With regards to
threat hunting, there will likely be a core set of stakeholders such as the CSO
and CISO however depending on the content of the communications, there may be
additional stakeholders that will need to be receive the communications as well.
Identifying and including the appropriate stake holders for the information is a
vital component to effective communication.

**Metric alignment** – Metrics should not be the main component of the
communications, but they should underpin the story of the communications.
Mapping the correct metrics, to key messaging, to the appropriate stakeholders
enables the communicator to select the 1 or 2 metrics that quantify the value of
a specific data point for the organization, specific business unit, or team.

With the communication strategy built, communications become easier to do and
more importantly more effective. It is worth the time, to build out a Goal, Key
Messaging, Stakeholders, and Metrics mapping for each of the metrics that you
are tracking within your threat hunting program.
