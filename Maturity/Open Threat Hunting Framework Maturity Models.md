# Maturity Models

The Open Group information security management maturity model (O-ISM3) describes
a maturity as the measurement of an organization’s ability implement continuous
improvement practices within a particular discipline. With a focus on continuous
improvement, maturity models are well suited for assessing threat hunting
operations.

Why maturity models are important for threat hunt teams:

-   Benchmarking – Determine where the threat hunt team is in terms of current
    state and compare against goals and objectives for performance improvement.

-   Performance Improvement – With a model a threat hunt team can directly track
    their operations against the best practices defined by the model. Maturity
    models can help organizations identify gaps which a plan that addresses
    specific issues.

-   Unified improvement language – Implementing a maturity model ensures that
    the entire threat hunting organization is aligned on future goals and using
    the same language to discuss capabilities that would enable the organization
    to increase their maturity with respect to the model.

The SQRRL “A Framework for Cyber Threat Hunting”[^1] white paper is one of the
most important papers released to the world of threat hunting and serves as a
foundational part of the OTHF. Within SQRRL’s works, they introduce the concept
of threat hunting specific maturity model and a set of criteria in which a
threat hunting program can be evaluated against.

Through the introduction of a maturity model, SQRRL created a way for threat
hunt teams to build short-, medium-, and long-term goals through some high-level
characteristics associated with the varying levels of maturity. Depending on the
organization, they may want to have more specific requirements and assessment
criteria laid out within the model and so the OTHF has created a maturity model
that organizations can use to assess their maturity against.
